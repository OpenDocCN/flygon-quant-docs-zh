    at `2` (there may be more, but I don''t know it), but there are more than 6 firms
    using it for internal purposes, including for example companies working in energy
    markets, due to the `compensation` feature which allows buying and selling different
    assets which compensate each other (this is probably not available in `zipline`)
    which allows to model using spot and futures prices (this is a particularity of
    energy markets to avoid having the actual goods delivered to you)'

    quote what someone from one of those banks told me: *"we use backtrader to quickly
    prototype our ideas and backtest them. If they prove to be what we expected and
    after further refinement, they will be rewritten in Java and put into our production
    system"*'

    may also be that some of the banks and companies decided to no longer use *backtrader*.

    same scheme.
