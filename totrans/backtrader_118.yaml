    which price plays a more important role than time. This has been introduced as
    a *filter* in release `1.9.54.122` of *backtrader*

    in the *backtrader* repository. Those values have to be fine tuned for each data

- en: One can see that the chart immediately reveals some resistance/support areas,
    which is one of the main advantages of the *Renko Bricks*. It should also be obvious
    that the temporal evolution in the X-Axis is no longer constant and is stretched
    or compressed, depending on whether the price action was more static during the
    period or moved several bricks.

- en: The strechting and compression of time periods is now a lot more obvious. One
    other factor to consider is how the focus on the price action also has an effect
    on the indicators which are applied, as shown by the two `RSI` indicators which
    have been placed on the chart.
