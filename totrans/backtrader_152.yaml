    I found a post about a moving average which tries to mimic the Jurik Moving Average
    (aka *JMA*)

    and the nature of `ec` and this finally led to *Ehlers* and the *Zero Lag Indicator*

    the dependencies on *Ehlers* and also on the *Hull Moving Average*, those two
    were also added to the arsenal of moving averages.

- en: Notice how the *Hull Moving Average* (aka *HMA*) starts producing values a couple
    of values later than the rest. This is due to the fact that is uses a *moving
    average* on *moving average* which delays the initial production.
