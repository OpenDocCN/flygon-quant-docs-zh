    *[http://fxcodebase.com](http://fxcodebase.com)*, but it seems difficult to track
    what the actual origin is.

    with a whooping 227 lines in the `MQL5` version (including some comments of course),
    and have slight differences, so the need arises to settle for a sound definition.

- en: The `RSI` / `STOCH` naming was chosen by the original implementors and `pointsize`
    is also known as `pipsize` which reflects its *Forex* origins. It is unclear if
    the *smoothing average* has to be the same as the previous moving average and
    some versions seem to work with an already averaged price rather than with the
    standard price. And the moving averages are selected using an *integer*.

    the user wants to run the indicator on an average price it can pass it, instead
    of passing the raw price.
